PHP Dynamic Multiplication Table
This project demonstrates how to generate a multiplication table dynamically using PHP and HTML. It is a simple yet effective example of using loops in PHP to create dynamic content.

Features
Generates a multiplication table for any given number.

Uses PHP loops for dynamic content generation.

Easy to customize the base number and range.

Lightweight project without external dependencies.

How It Works
A PHP variable is set as the base number (e.g., 15).

A for loop runs through a range (1 to 10) to calculate and display the multiplication results.

Each result is displayed within a <div> element for easy styling.

Use Cases
Educational tools for learning or teaching multiplication.

Beginner-level PHP projects.

Demonstrating dynamic HTML content generation using PHP.

Example Output
For a base number of 15, the output will be:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
15 x 1 = 15
15 x 2 = 30
15 x 3 = 45
...
15 x 10 = 150
Customization
Change the base number by modifying the PHP variable.

Adjust the range of the table by changing the loop limits.

Add custom CSS for improved table styling.
